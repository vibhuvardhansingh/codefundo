## Present Voting System
The right to vote is an inalienable part of a citizen’s right in a democracy, subject to certain conditions laid down by the state. As per the Election commission of India, citizens are eligible to become voters only if he/she is enrolled at place of residence. At present voting is done in EVMs.

## Current Issues
1. Today due to the migration of people to cities because of healthy life style majority of voters are missing. This leads to uneven population in diferent constituencies.
2. Differnt political parties have questioned about the hacking done in EVMs. This can be great threat to democracy.  
  
## Digital Voting System (using the blockchain)  
The blockchain is a digital platform for digital assets. It consists of a continuously growing list of records known as blocks that are linked and secured using cryptography. Major usage of Blockchain has been in all cryptocurrency transactions, mainly Bitcoin. However, they are increasingly being used in a number of other applications because of their inherent resistance to modification to the transaction/block/whole distributed ledger - Blockchain. One such application is Electronic Voting. We will review some of the variety of blockchain technologies that are usable, scalable and secure, fit for Electronic Voting Application.

## Conclusion   
In this paper, we proposed an electronic voting system using multi-chain. We showed how multi- chain can be configured to restrict transactions to only one vote between voter and contestant. A new entity – trusted third party – was introduced to keep the voting secret. Without this organization, it’s not possible to maintain voter anonymity and whom the voter votes for. This is also necessary to avoid forgery of votes by either the Election Commission or trusted hird party. We stablished a workflow between authentication organization, trusted third party and multi- chain ledger. In the end, we showed how auditing can ensure authenticity of the entire system.
